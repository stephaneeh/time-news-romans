## Description

This project is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Structure

- `server.js` The primary application script
- `\db` Holds the required mysql scripts to create and set up the initial application database


## Installation
In your command line interface (cli), navigate to the application directory and run the following commands:
```md
> npm install

```

## Usage
Set up your database by running the following command in your DB directory
```md
> mysql -u root
> SOURCE schema.sql;
> EXIT
```

Move to root directory of your proejct and run the following commands to seed your database and start the application
```md
> npm run seed
> npm start
```
